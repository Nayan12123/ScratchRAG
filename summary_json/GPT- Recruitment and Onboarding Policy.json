    "doc_text": "# Recruitment and Onboarding Policy\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nSimpplr is committed to attracting and hiring top talent that aligns with our values and organizational culture. This policy outlines our approach to recruitment and onboarding, ensuring a fair and consistent process.\n\n# 2. Background Checks and Investigations\n\n# 2.1 Pre-Employment Background Checks\n\nBefore extending a job offer, Simpplr conducts pre-employment background checks. This includes verifying educational qualifications, previous employment history, and criminal record checks as permitted by law. Background checks are conducted in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal laws.\n\n# 2.2 Investigations\n\nSimpplr reserves the right to conduct investigations into potential workplace misconduct or violations of company policies. These investigations may be initiated based on reasonable suspicion or a formal complaint. Investigations will be fair, confidential, and conducted by trained personnel.\n\n# 3. Internal Transfers\n\nSimpplr encourages employees to explore growth opportunities within the organization. Internal job postings will be regularly communicated to employees, allowing them to express interest and apply for available positions. The selection process for internal transfers will be based on the candidate's qualifications, skills, and experience relevant to the position.\n\n# 4. Application Process\n\n# 4.1 Job Posting and Advertising\n\nAll job vacancies will be advertised internally to provide existing employees with the opportunity to apply. Additionally, job postings will be made available externally through various platforms, including but not limited to the company website, professional networks, and job portals.\n\n# 4.2 Application Submission\n\nApplicants are required to submit their application materials through the designated application channels within the specified deadline. Submission should include a resume/CV and any other documents as outlined in the job posting.\n\n# 4.3 Selection Process\n\nSimpplr follows a fair and objective selection process to assess candidates' qualifications and suitability for the position. This may include screening interviews, assessments, reference checks, and panel interviews.\n\n# 5. Employee Referral Bonus\n\n# 5.1 Eligibility\n\n# 5. Employee Referrals\n\nTo encourage employee referrals, Simpplr offers a referral bonus to eligible employees who refer candidates resulting in successful hires. Employees, except those in the HR department or in a hiring role, are eligible for the referral bonus.\n\n# 5.2 Referral Process\n\nEmployees can refer candidates by submitting an employee referral form, providing pertinent information about the candidate. The form should be submitted before or at the same time as the candidate's application.\n\n# 5.3 Bonus Payout\n\nThe referral bonus is paid out in two parts - half upon the candidate's successful onboarding and the remaining half after the referred employee completes six months of continuous employment. The bonus amount may vary, depending on the level and criticality of the position.\n\n# 6. Hiring of Relatives\n\nWhile Simpplr values diversity and equal opportunity, we recognize that there may be occasions when related individuals may both qualify for employment. In such cases, the final hiring decision will be made based on the best interests of the company, avoiding any potential conflicts of interest or nepotism.\n\n# 6.1 Disclosure Requirement\n\nEmployees who have a family relationship with a potential candidate must disclose this fact to HR either during the application process or before any final decisions are made. This enables HR to ensure an unbiased and transparent hiring process.\n\n# 6.2 Conflict of Interest\n\nIf a job position becomes open and an employee has a relative in a comparable role, Simpplr ensures that employees are treated fairly by considering the employees' qualifications and performance. The final decision is made based on objectives such as merit, skills, experience, and organizational fit.\n\n# 7. Conclusion\n\nSimpplr's Recruitment and Onboarding Policy aims to attract and select top talent while maintaining fairness, objectivity, and compliance with legal and ethical standards. This policy provides guidance to employees, managers, and HR professionals involved in the recruitment and onboarding process, ensuring a positive and inclusive work environment."
