False,Compare the eligibility criteria and payout structure of Simpplr's referral bonus with their policy on hiring relatives.,"The eligibility criteria for Simpplr's referral bonus states that employees, except those in the HR department or in a hiring role, are eligible for the referral bonus if they refer candidates who result in successful hires. In contrast, the policy on hiring relatives emphasizes that while related individuals may both qualify for employment, the final hiring decision will be based on merit, skills, experience, and organizational fit to avoid conflicts of interest or nepotism.

However, the payout structure for the referral bonus is not specified in the provided context, and there is no mention of a payout structure related to the hiring of relatives. Therefore, a direct comparison of the payout structure cannot be made based on the available information.

Answer: Don't Know","Simpplr's referral bonus eligibility and payout structure are distinct from its policy on hiring relatives. 

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- **Referral Bonus:** Employees, except those in HR or hiring roles, are eligible for the referral bonus.
- **Hiring Relatives:** Employees must disclose family relationships with potential candidates during the application process or before final decisions to avoid conflicts of interest.

**Payout Structure:**
- **Referral Bonus:** The bonus is paid in two parts: half upon the candidate's successful onboarding and the remaining half after six months of continuous employment. The amount varies based on the position's level and criticality.
- **Hiring Relatives:** There is no financial incentive mentioned. The focus is on maintaining fairness and transparency, ensuring decisions are based on merit, skills, experience, and organizational

False,"How does simpplr's Expense Reimbursement Policy ensure fair, consistent, and compliant reimbursement for business expenses?","Simpplr's Expense Reimbursement Policy ensures fair, consistent, and compliant reimbursement for business expenses by establishing clear guidelines and procedures for employees to follow when submitting expense claims. The policy aims to maintain transparency and minimize the likelihood of fraudulent claims, aligning with relevant legal and tax regulations. Additionally, the policy emphasizes the importance of familiarizing employees with the guidelines to ensure compliance and fair reimbursement practices. By processing reimbursements in a timely manner, typically in the next payroll cycle, the policy reinforces the company's commitment to fiscal responsibility and accountability in handling employee expenses.","Simpplr's Expense Reimbursement Policy ensures fair, consistent, and compliant reimbursement for business expenses through several key measures:

1. **Clear Guidelines**: The policy outlines eligible expenses, including travel, accommodation, office supplies, communication, and professional development, ensuring employees know what can be reimbursed.

2. **Submission and Documentation Requirements**: Employees must submit expense claims within 30 days with appropriate documentation, such as receipts and invoices, to ensure transparency and accuracy.

3. **Approval Process**: Expense claims must be approved by the employee's immediate supervisor or designated approver, verifying that the expenses comply with policy guidelines and are work-related.

4. **Reimbursement Limits**: The policy may set maximum reimbursement limits for certain categories to control costs and prevent abuse, with exceptions requiring approval.

5. **Prohibited Expenses**: It clearly states that personal expenses, fines, unauthorized purchases, and any expenses violating company policies or regulations are not reimbursable.

6. **Timely Reimbursement**: Reimbursements are processed quickly, typically in the next payroll cycle, ensuring employees are compensated promptly.

7. **Compliance and Monitoring**: Simpplr reserves the right to audit expense claims periodically to ensure adherence to the policy, with non-compliance potentially leading to disciplinary action.

1. **Personal and Paid Leave Policy**:
   - **Eligibility**: All full-time and part-time employees who have completed at least six months of continuous employment with Simpplr are eligible for personal and paid leaves.
   - **Documentation Requirements**: While specific documentation requirements are not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that employees should communicate with their supervisors and the Human Resources department when requesting leave.

2. **Parental Leave Policy**:
   - **Eligibility**: Employees must have been employed by Simpplr for a minimum of six months continuously, intend to return to work after the leave period, and provide at least four weeks' notice, except in emergencies or unforeseen circumstances.
   - **Documentation Requirements**: The requirement to provide notice suggests that some form of documentation or communication is necessary, particularly for planned parental leave.

3. **Employee Stock Options Policy**:
   - While this policy does not directly relate to leave, it specifies that employees must have completed a minimum of one year of continuous service and be in good standing to participate in the stock option program.

Overall, the leave policies emphasize the importance of communication and notice for eligibility, particularly for parental leave, while personal and paid leave eligibility is based on tenure. Specific documentation requirements for personal and paid leave are not explicitly stated.","Simpplr's leave policies emphasize the well-being and work-life balance of employees by providing various types of leave. Eligibility varies based on employment duration and type of leave:

1. **Personal Leave**:
   - **Eligibility**: Available to full-time and part-time employees after six months of continuous employment.
   - **Duration**: Up to 5 days per year, unpaid.
   - **Documentation**: Reasonable notice to supervisor and HR; documentation may be required for unforeseen circumstances.

2. **Paid Sick Leave**:
   - **Eligibility**: Available to employees for their own or an immediate family member's illness.
   - **Duration**: Up to 10 days per calendar year, paid.
   - **Documentation**: Medical certification may be required based on illness nature and duration.

3. **Bereavement Leave**:
   - **Eligibility**: Available in the event of an immediate family member's death.
   - **Duration**: Up to 5 consecutive days, paid.
   - **Documentation**: Death certificates or other relevant documents may be required.

**Application Process**:
   - **Notice and Approval**: Notify supervisor and HR at least 48 hours in advance if possible; submit a written request with reason, duration, and supporting documentation.
   - **Documentation and Certification**: Depending on leave type, provide appropriate documents (medical certificates, death certificates, etc.).

Overall, the policy ensures employees can take necessary time off while maintaining job security and compensation, fostering a supportive and inclusive work

The Personal and Paid Leave Policy aims to create an inclusive and supportive work environment that allows employees to take time off for personal reasons, such as illness, family emergencies, or personal appointments, while ensuring they are compensated during their absence.

If you have any specific questions related to Simpplr's HR policies, feel free to ask!","If Simpplr's commitment to a harassment-free workplace were suddenly rescinded, it would likely have severe negative impacts on employees' well-being and workplace culture. Without the protections and protocols outlined in the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy, employees might feel unsafe and unsupported.
